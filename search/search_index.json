Manifest public key A manifest public key is used to verify the manifest generated by the Secure Build. Manifest private key A manifest private key is used to sign the manifest during the Secure Build. Namespace A namespace such as ibmzcontainersthat contains a number of unique images. For examples, the images include hpvsop-base, hyperpcons-worker, hyperpcons-riaas, and so on. Node Member of a Hyper Protect DBaaS cluster. Nodes in one cluster are runq containers/VMs that run on shared hardware. The equivalent of server in PostgreSQL terms. Partition A partition is the logic partition (LPAR) on the mainframe, and can be created by using the logic partitioning tools such as Hardware Management Console (HMC) or other logical partitioning tools. PKCS #11 The abbreviation of Public-Key Cryptography Standards #11, which defines a platform-independent API to cryptographic tokens, such as HSM and smart cards. Primary node The cluster member that receives all write operations in Hyper Protect DBaaS. Quotagroup The storage assigned to a workload running on an appliance. The appliance administrator assigns FCP, or ECKD based storage to an appliance. He then creates quotagroups, representing parts of the underlying storage. He finally assigns quotagroups to workloads through the appliance API. Replica The secondary nodes in a Hyper Protect DBaaS cluster. See \"Secondary node\". Replication A feature allowing multiple database servers to share the same data, thereby ensuring redundancy and facilitating load balancing. Replication lag The length of time between the last operation in the primary\u2019s oplog and the last operation applied to a particular secondary. RIAS The abbreviation of Regional Infrastructure API Service, which offers the APIs associated with providing the VPC User experience for Cloud IaaS. Genesis and control plane sit behind the RIAS API layer. Root keys A symmetric wrapping key that is used for encrypting and decrypting other keys that are stored in a data service. Registry A Registry is a hosted service containing repositories of container images that responds to the Registry API. For example, Docker Hub. Repository A repository is a set of containerized images. A repository can be shared by pushing it to a registry server. Different images in the repository can be labeled using tags. For example, hpvsop-base. Repository definition files An encrypted registration file or a repository definition file is used to register the repository, for authentication or validation reasons, such that a Hosting Appliance will trust that the image, when pulled from the registry, is authentic. Repository registration files A cleartext Python or JSON format file, which is generated by the Secure Build container when the container is created. The JSON format repository registration file can be used as the direct input to generate an encrypted repository definition file.

For example, latest, 1.2.3.4-develop-a0d3aea, or s390x-develop-54a9045. Trusted Key Entry application The application installed as part of the Management Utilities. It uses smart cards to load master keys in service instances and to perform other configuration tasks for service instances. VPC The abbreviation of Virtual Private Cloud, which is the basis of IBM Cloud IaaS offerings into the future. The User experience is on top of Genesis. VPC Gen 1 Early implementation of VPC on top of pre-existing APIs rather than Genesis control plane. VPC Gen 2 The version of IaaS which provides VPC on top of the pure genesis control plane. This is the first entry point for the ZaaS IaaS. Workload The application and data provided and generated by a (running) Workload Image. Workload Data Workload user or workload client data, workload logs, workload secrets stored in the appliance. Workload Image A container-based image, provided by the Workload Vendor.
