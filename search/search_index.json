Hyper Protect Virtual Server is IBM\u2019s open application environment that is uniquely engineered for trusted computing. This workshop provides a primer on Hyper Protect Virtual Server and practical use cases relevant to the enterprise. In addition, you will gain hands-on experience with IBM\u2019s unique secure image build process to build a secure image and deploy it inside a FIPS 197-compliant protected memory enclave. Next, you will learn about Hyper Protect Virtual Server\u2019s crypto service built on a FIPS 140-2 Level 4-compliant HSM. Lastly, you will gain hands-on experience exploiting the crypto service. Agenda Introduction to Hyper Protect Virtual Server Hyper Protect Use Cases Demo Introduction to the Secure Image Build Process Lab: Build and Deploy Your First Hyper Protect Virtual Server Image Introduction to HSM-backed Crypto Service Lab: Crypto Service Exploitation Next Steps on Your Journey Wrap Up Acknowledgements Thanks to the following people who helped us test out the labs: Kevin Breitenother, Victoria Coates, Brandon Nguyen, Jasmine Burgess, Austin Grice Authors Barry Silliman Garrett Woodworth Jin VanStee","title":"Home"},{"location":"#hyper-protect-virtual-server-wildfire-workshop","text":"Welcome to our Hyper Protect Virtual Server workshop.
